<h3>* intentional communities</h3>
Social networks are cool, but the future is in healing our disconnection from each other, along with all other vital aspects of life, through creating community in real life.
<h3>* democratic confederalism</h3>
First-past-the-post federal democracy is cool, but the future is in organizing democracy from the ground up, with modern voting tools.

<h3>* discsports: ultimate &amp; disc golf</h3>
Sports are cool, but the future (mark my words) is in ultimate frisbee, given its combination of incredible athletic highlight-reel play, self-officiated structure, and mixed-gender play at the highest levels. I've done some guest color commentary for the semi-pro AUDL <a href="http://sjspiders.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Jose Spiders</a> game livestreams. During the pandemic, disc golf also exploded in popularity, and I've gained a new-found love for it as well.
