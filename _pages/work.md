#### I help people use technology to help other people.

I help folks with a cool social mission formulate and execute startup nonprofit/business planning, strategy, and operations. Although I'm not strictly a web developer or designer, over the years I've also developed a strong expertise in using the free & open source WordPress website creation ecosystem to create and host a variety of digital projects, from simple brochure sites to full-blown membership communities with thousands of individual accounts. Nowadays, AI-assisted coding tools allow me to use a variety of stacks besides WordPress, greatly widening the services and solutions I have been able to provide clients.

Besides helping small mission-focused organizations get on their feet, since around 2013 I've focused on the digital currency movement, especially on community-based mutual credit currencies (as opposed to speculative assets).

#### If you have an altruistic mission and a big vision but few resources, I can probably help you, too.


#### I find solutions...

I draw on experience in a wide range of disciplines to identify key issues, and make progress.


#### To reach your goals...

I navigate technology so that people who help the world can focus on giving their own gifts.


#### Without breaking the bank!

Much of my work is for non-profits at a reduced rate, or via a pay-what-you-can arrangement.

**My Values**
-------------

I can argue any side of an argument, and I don't really believe in absolutes. But I do believe:

#### **trust > control** **inspiration > calculation** **cooperation > competition** **benefit > profit** **empathy > sympathy**
